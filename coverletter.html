                            <p>To whomever it may concern,</p>
                            <p>When I wrote my first "hello world" program at around 12 or 13 years old, my reasons for coding were simple: I wanted to make games. Nearly a decade later, my reasons for coding are more complex but fundamentally still the same; I have a passion for creativity and problem solving, and I love combining those passions to create things with code. Nothing reminds me of that passion quite like <i>Dreams</i>, which is why I sought out the position of Community Features Programmer at Media Molecule.</p>
                            <p>I am an upcoming college graduate receiving a Bachelor's in Computer Science. My education has given me a solid foundation in theoretical math and programming, but I have also developed my skill set through the practical experience I've gained making my own projects. As a result, I am now an experienced programmer who is practiced in game development, capable of applying classroom concepts to their code, and adept at independently learning new languages and libraries. Moreover, my internships have broadened my learning and I am now also familiar with QA testing, working on an Agile (Scrum) team, and developing for a virtual reality environment in Unity.</p>
                            <p>It's rare to see a company whose values are so present in the work they produce. The fact that I don't need to Google a mission statement to know that Media Molecule values creativity and community speaks volumes about the people that work there and the culture they promote. So while I believe my technical skill set makes me qualified for this position, what makes me truly a good fit for the role is the same thing that led me to apply for it: the passion for art, creativity, and community that I share with the team.</p>
                            <p>I would be thrilled with the opportunity to interview with you. I can be reached either by phone (+1 316 299-3189) or by email (matthew.madden@protonmail.com). Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>
                            <p>Matt Madden</p>

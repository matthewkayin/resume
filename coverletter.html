                            <p>To whomever it may concern,</p>
                            <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Front End Developer position at Koch. I am a software developer with a passion for using code to combine creativity, problem solving, and critical thinking. With an extensive education in software engineering, and experience applying that education to real projects across a variety of technologies, I am confident that I will be an asset to your team and an ideal fit for this role.
                            <p>This past year I have worked as a QA tester at NetApp, which has given me exposure to quality assurance and valuable insight into the way QA teams interact with developers in the real world. Before then, as a VR programmer at NIAR, I gained experience developing small software solutions in order to meet client specifications. I also spent a year working as an official in my University's Student Government Association. This experience greatly developed my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills, preparing me to work as a member of a development team and not simply as a solitary programmer.</p>
                            <p>Which isn't to say my skills as a programmer are lacking. Quite the contrary, I have a great passion for coding which has caused me take time outside of my classes to code, develop side projects, and experiment with new languages and technology. As a result I am now experienced with a number of different languages and technologies, and I am highly adept at learning new ones. Furthermore, I have great familiarity with Linux since I have used it as my primary OS for daily use and development for the past 2 years.</p>
                            <p>My resume goes into greater detail regarding my skillset and past experience. After looking it over, I hope you will grant me the opportunity to interview with you. I can be reached either by phone (+1 316 299-3189) or by email (matthew.madden@protonmail.com). Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
                            <p>Sincerely,</p>
                            <p>Matt Madden</p>
